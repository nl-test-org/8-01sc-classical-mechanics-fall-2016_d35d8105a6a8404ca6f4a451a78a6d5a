![A diagram of two colliding blocks.](/coursemedia/8-01sc-classical-mechanics-fall-2016/e11c8a5bacd3aece5290c369d8582292_fridayw6_1_1.svg)

Block 1 of mass \\(\\displaystyle 3m\\) is sliding along a frictionless horizontal table to the right with speed \\(\\displaystyle v\_0\\). Block 1 collides with block 2 of mass \\(\\displaystyle m\\) that is moving to the left with speed \\(\\displaystyle v\_0\\). After the collision, the two blocks stick together and the blocks enter a rough surface at \\(\\displaystyle x=0\\) with a coefficient of kinetic friction that increases with distance as \\(\\displaystyle \\mu (x)=b x^2\\) for \\(\\displaystyle 0\\leq x\\leq d\\), where \\(\\displaystyle b\\) is a positive constant. The blocks come to rest at \\(\\displaystyle x=d\\). The downward gravitational acceleration has magnitude \\(\\displaystyle g\\). Determine an expression for the initial speed \\(\\displaystyle v\_0\\) of the blocks.
