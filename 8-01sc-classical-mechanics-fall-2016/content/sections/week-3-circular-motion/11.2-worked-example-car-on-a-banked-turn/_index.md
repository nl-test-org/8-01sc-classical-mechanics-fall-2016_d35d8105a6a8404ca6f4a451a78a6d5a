A car of mass \\(\\displaystyle m\\) is turning on a banked curve of angle \\(\\displaystyle \\phi\\) with respect to the horizontal. The curve is icy and friction between the tires and the surface is negligible. The curve has a radius \\(\\displaystyle r\\). What is the speed \\(\\displaystyle v\\) at which the car can turn safely? Express your answer in terms of \\(\\displaystyle g\\), \\(\\displaystyle r\\), and \\(\\displaystyle \\phi\\).
